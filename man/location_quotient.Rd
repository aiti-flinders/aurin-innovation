\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame}

\item{min_value}{numeric. the smallest total value allowable in a geographic region.}

\item{total_var}{character. the name of the variable which must be greater than the \code{min_value}. This variable
must be present in the data passed to the function.}

\description{
Calculate location quotient from any data which contains a column
specifying a geographic variable, a second variable such as industry of employment, and a value. The data provided
is converted into a matrix with dimensions x_var * y_var. The variable specified as value_var fills the matrix.
