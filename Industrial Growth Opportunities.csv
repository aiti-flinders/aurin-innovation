,"The industrial growth opportunities dataset links the measure of regional industrial comparative advantage derived from place of work employment by industry, with a state based model of economic complexity. Where the state model of economic complexity allows for the identification of product opportunities at the state level, by linking product opportunities with the industry in which it belongs, and the industrial strengths of a region, we can identify which regions are best placed to develop new industrial capabilities. In order to refine the results, a number of filters are applied to the data. These are:
1.  Only industries in which a region has an industrial comparative advantage (RICA >=1) are considered 
2.  Products which are exported by Australian states in some capacity (export value > 0) but not to the extent that a state has a comparative advantage in the export of that product (SECA > 0) 
3. Looking only at products which would improve the states complexity outlook (Product Development Benefit >0)",

Variable,Description,Data Source
Statistical Area 2 Code,"9 digit code representing the statistical area. Note that changes were made to the ABS geography between 2011 and 2016, and some SA2s defined in 2011 do not have a direct match in the 2016 data. ",ABS ASGS 2011 and 2016
Statistical Area 2 Name,Name corresponding to SA2 code,
Product Opportunity,The short name of the product opportunity identified for the region. ,
Product Code,4 digit code representing the product opportunity. Product codes are based on the Harmonised System of classifying traded products. The codes reflect products classified in the 1992 version of the harmonised system.,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/atlas
Product Development Benefit,"The increase in complexity outlook for the State from a region developing a significant capability in a product.

From the Atlas of Economic Complexity:
Measures how much a location could benefit in opening future diversification opportunities by developing a particular product. Complexity outlook gain quantifies how a new product can open up links to more, and more complex, products. Complexity outlook gain classifies the strategic value of a product based on the new paths to diversification in more complex sectors that it opens up.

Complexity outlook gain accounts for the complexity of the products not being produced in a location and the distance or how close to existing capabilities that new product is.",
Product Industry,The industry in which the Product Opportunity belongs. ,ABS Merchandise trade appendices 2018
Region Industry Comparative Advantage (RICA),"How well developed an industry is in a region, based on the level of employment. It is calculated using a location quotient method where a value greater than 1 indicates that the share of employment in an industry in the region is larger than the share of employment in the same industry in Australia. ",
State,The name of the state corresponding to the SA2,
State Export Value,The amount (in US dollars) of the product opportunity exported by the state for a given year. ,AITI State Economic Complexity 
State Export Comparative Advantage (SECA),"From the Atlas of Economic Complexity:
A measure of whether a state is an exporter of a product, based on the relative advantage or disadvantage a country has in the export of a certain good. Balassa’s definition of comparative advantage is used, which says that a state is an effective exporter of a product if it exports more than its “fair share,” or a share that is at least equal to the share of total world trade that the product represents (Comparative Advantage greater than 1).",Country export values are obtained from the atlas of economic complexity. State export values are obtained from the Queensland government's statistics office
